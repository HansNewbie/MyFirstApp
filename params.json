{"name":"Feel Good","tagline":"http://developer.android.com/training/index.html","body":"**V3.0** _- in Progress_\r\nRenamed to Feel Good (sounds better). This would enable more messages to come up randomly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**V2.0**\r\nRenamed the App to Praise Yourself. Made to make people feel better. This is an upgrade from the tutorial. You need to put in your name, click send, and a message will pop up. Intended to make more messages, but I faced some trouble of immutable String in the development.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\n\r\n**V1.0**\r\nI followed the Android tutorial for the first app to send message to the screen.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
